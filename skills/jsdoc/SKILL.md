## Add JSDoc Comments

File: **$1**

1. Read the file. Identify all public functions, methods, types, and interfaces without JSDoc.

2. For each, write a JSDoc comment that includes:
   - `@description` — what it does (one sentence)
   - `@param` — each parameter with type and description
   - `@returns` — return value description
   - `@throws` — if it can throw, what and when
   - `@example` — a short usage example for non-obvious functions

Follow TSDoc format (`/** */`) for TypeScript files.

3. Rules:
   - Don't state the obvious: `// Gets the user` → write *why/when* to use it
   - Private/internal functions: add a brief comment only if logic is non-obvious
   - Don't add params that are self-explanatory single-letter generics

4. Apply all comments to the file.
